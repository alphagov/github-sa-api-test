# Test implementation of GitHub GraphQL and REST API 

## Setup 

In a python 3 virtual env 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
python generate_schema.py 
```
Create a file called token containing a personal access token 
string.

## Run 

So far this just runs a bunch of API calls and generates a GQL 
query from variables. 

```
python dashboard.py
```
